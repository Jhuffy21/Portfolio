# Wage Gap Analysis Project
## Overview
* This project aims to analyze the wage gap trends between different demographic groups, focusing on education levels and gender. Using historical data, we examine trends, perform visualizations, and employ linear regression to make future predictions.

## Data
* The dataset comprises the following columns:
* year: The year of the data.
* high_school: Average salary for individuals with only a high school diploma.
* bachelors_degree: Average salary for individuals with a bachelor's degree.
* men_high_school: Average salary for men with only a high school diploma.
* men_bachelors_degree: Average salary for men with a bachelor's degree.
* women_high_school: Average salary for women with only a high school diploma.
* women_bachelors_degree: Average salary for women with a bachelor's degree.
  
## Key Insights:
* There's a widening wage gap between college graduates and high school graduates over the years.
* Gender plays a role in the wage gap, with differences observed based on education levels.
* Despite the increase in wages for women with college degrees, the wage gap in the college-educated demographic continues to expand.
* In contrast, the wage gap in the high school-educated demographic shows a decreasing trend.
  
## Predictive Modeling
* Linear regression models were developed to:
* Predict the change in the wage gap over the years.
* The model provides insights into the future trajectory of the wage gap based on current and historical trends.

## Visualization
* Visual plots are included to better understand the dataset and the predictions made by the model. These plots offer a graphical representation of the trends over the years.

## Dependencies:
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
  
## How to Run:
* Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed.
* Download the dataset and the Jupyter Notebook (or Python script).
* Run the notebook/script to perform the analysis and view the visualizations.
  
## Future Work:
* Incorporate additional data, such as location or industry, to provide a more comprehensive analysis.
* Implement more advanced predictive models for improved accuracy.
* Compare wage gap trends with other socio-economic indicators.
